      <description>Phew, what a day! Just finished my installtion of Jitsi meet on my linux server (DigitalOcean droplet).
You know when you go to Jitsi website and start exploring as a beginner, you find it really hard to navigate, not so much documentation, any beginner like me can get lost easily and becomes frustrated.
Well, I have my fare share of working knowledge on WebRTC and some SFU, I wanted to explore Jitsi meet too.</description>
